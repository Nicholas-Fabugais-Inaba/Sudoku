# Sudoku
My goal for this project is to understand and implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle as well as allow the user to fill it out themselves.  Additionally, a sudoku board generator will be implemented providing the user with a random board each time allowing them to solve a variety of puzzles. This will all then be displayed as a GUI utitilizing a pygame window. Within this GUI, the user will be able to input correct and incorrect values to solve the sudoku puzzle as well as the opportunity to have the puzzle solve itself with a solve button implemented at the bottom of the window.

By coding this in Python I will not only be able to help myself refine my previous skills, but I will be able to develop my knowledge within the language itself.
