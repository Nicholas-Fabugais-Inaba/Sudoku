# Sudoku
My goal for this project is to understand and implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle as well as allow the user to fill it out themselves. By coding this in Python I will be able to refine my skills and develop my knowledge in the language. Additionally, a sudoku board generator will be implemented providing the user with a random board each time allowing them to solve a variety of puzzles.
